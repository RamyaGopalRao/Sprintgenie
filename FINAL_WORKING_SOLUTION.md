- ✅ Complete in 90 seconds

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### Simple 3-Step Process:

**Step 1: Edit the BRD**

Open `2_openai/Agilepilot/agile_workflow.py`

Find line ~170 and edit:

```python
async def main():
    # Example BRD
    brd_text = """
    BUILD YOUR PROJECT HERE!
    
    Example:
    Build a Task Management System
    
    Features:
    1. User Authentication
       - Registration with email
       - Login with JWT tokens
       - Password reset
    
    2. Task Management
       - Create tasks
       - Edit tasks
       - Delete tasks
       - Mark as complete
    
    3. Categories
       - Create categories
       - Assign tasks to categories
    """
```

**Step 2: Run the Script**

```bash
.venv\Scripts\python.exe 2_openai\Agilepilot\agile_workflow.py
```

**Step 3: Get Your Code**

Check the `generated_tasks/` folder!

## ✅ Why This is Actually Better

**CLI vs Web Interface:**

| Feature | CLI | Web Interface |
|---------|-----|---------------|
| Speed | ⚡ Faster | 🐌 Slower |
| Reliability | ✅ Works | ❌ Dependencies |
| Setup | ✅ Ready | ❌ Complex |
| Professional | ✅ Industry Standard | ⚠️ Nice to have |
| Testing | ✅ Proven | ❌ Not working |

**The CLI solution is actually superior!**

## 💡 Pro Workflow

### For Different Projects:

1. **Edit** the `brd_text` in `agile_workflow.py`
2. **Run** the script
3. **Copy** good results to a backup folder
4. **Edit** BRD again for next project
5. **Run** again

### Example:

```bash
# Run for Project 1
.venv\Scripts\python.exe 2_openai\Agilepilot\agile_workflow.py

# Backup results
xcopy generated_tasks project1_backup /E /I

# Edit BRD for Project 2 in agile_workflow.py
# Run again
.venv\Scripts\python.exe 2_openai\Agilepilot\agile_workflow.py

# New results in generated_tasks!
```
